#0x01. Python - if/else, loops, functions
python conditions, loops and functions

## 0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing 
This program will assign a random signed number to the variable number each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable number is positive or negative.
## 1. The last digit 
This program will assign a random signed number to the variable number each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable number.
## 2. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game 
 a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line.
## 3. When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off 
a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line.
## 4. Hexadecimal printing 
a program that prints all numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and in hexadecimal (as in the following example)
## 5. 00...99 
a program that prints numbers from 0 to 99.
## 6. Inventing is a combination of brains and materials. The more brains you use, the less material you need
a program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits.

    Numbers must be separated by ,, followed by a space
    The two digits must be different
    01 and 10 are considered the same combination of the two digits 0 and 1
    Print only the smallest combination of two digits
    Numbers should be printed in ascending order, with two digits
    The last number should be followed by a new line
## 7. islower 
a function that checks for lowercase character.

    Prototype: def islower(c):
    Returns True if c is lowercase
    Returns False otherwise
## 8. To uppercase 
 function that prints a string in uppercase followed by a new line.

    Prototype: def uppercase(str):
## 9. There are only 3 colors, 10 digits, and 7 notes; it's what we do with them that's important 
a function that prints the last digit of a number.

    Prototype: def print_last_digit(number):
    Returns the value of the last digit
## 10. a + b
a function that adds two integers and returns the result.

    Prototype: def add(a, b):
    Returns the value of a + b
## 11. a ^ b 
a function that computes a to the power of b and return the value.

    Prototype: def pow(a, b):
    Returns the value of a ^ b
## 12. Fizz Buzz
a function that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 separated by a space.

    For multiples of three print Fizz instead of the number and for multiples of five print Buzz.
    For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print FizzBuzz.
    Prototype: def fizzbuzz():
    Each element should be followed by a space
## 13. Insert in sorted linked list
a function in C that inserts a number into a sorted singly linked list.

    Prototype: listint_t *insert_node(listint_t **head, int number);
    Return: the address of the new node, or NULL if it failed
